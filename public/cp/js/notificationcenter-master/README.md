jquery.notificationcenter
=========================

Original idea and code from
  https://github.com/mbuonomo/notificationcenter

Apple OS X Style Notification Center for web

Demo/Documentation: http://thesin-.github.io/notificationcenter/

FEATURES
* Document title modification to show alert count
* Display only a certain amount of notifs at once
* Sound notification if the user is on an other tab/page
* Per type Sounds/Colors/alert timeout and notif count displayed
* Pop up alerts that are not retained in the notif pane
* Click overlay when the pane is open so any click closes the pane
* Notif callbacks, including a redisplay notification option
* Export callback so you can save the list of current notifs
* Mobile compat, includes options for swipe delete on notifs
* Mobile on notifications stay in viewport even with pinch zoom
* CSS Styled allows lots of styling control to the site
* Allow ajax and/or faye alerts on top of js calls to create alerts

TODO
* Add a 'poof' effect like OS X instead of slide right for close
* once notificationul hits to bottom stack a stagger stack
